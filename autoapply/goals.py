"""Weekly goals: a few totals the person sets on Sunday (applications, and hours for reaching out, interview prep
and learning), spread across the days they pick, counted up each day, and a look-back that flows into next week.

Why: writing a plan helped people find work in a field trial, and reminders added nothing (Abel et al.); specific
"when" plans turn intentions into search (van Hooft et al. 2005); a structured day goes with better wellbeing out
of work (Jahoda; Feather and Bond 1983). Mood and progress swing day to day (Wanberg, Zhu and van Hooft 2010), so the
week is the goal and a short day is credit, never a failure: counts go up, there are no streaks, nothing nags
(VOICE.md rules 2, 6 and 7). The plan never changes the daily run or the work-search count.

Stored in pal_notes (coach.note): the plan at plan:<week> (roles, days, contact as before, plus goals and per_day),
time marked done at done:<day>, and the look-back note at lookback:<week>. Old plans without goals read as before.
