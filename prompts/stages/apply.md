Today's job search, one application: {{JOB_ID}}. Follow AGENTS.md (read CLAUDE.local.md and materials/context/*.md
first). Work only on this role.
{{PREP_ONLY}}

1. `autoapply show {{JOB_ID}}` for the posting. If its ats is "feed", find the same role on the company's own careers
   page (ATS URL) and work from that; if it's gone there, print "<Company>: posting gone" and stop.
   If WebFetch shows the careers page with no jobs listed (many load the list with a script, often an embedded
   Paycom, iCIMS or UKG board), run `autoapply careers <careers page url> --title "<title>"` before calling it
   gone: it opens the page in a real browser and lists the job links, best title match first.
   If its ats is "manual", the person pasted the post: tailor against its description and finish the way step 3
   does (plan.json and `fill --prep-only`); there's no form to fill.
   `autoapply resume-outline` prints the base resume (headline, summary, skills, each experience block's bullets).
   Work from that; don't open the .docx or PDFs with python, `pdftotext` or `pdfinfo`.
2. Tailor the resume and write a cover letter: write data/applications/<company-slug>/docs.json, then run
   `autoapply build-docs <company-slug>`. It makes both .docx and .pdf files and prints their page counts.
   docs.json (leave out any part to keep the base as is):
   {"company": "<Company>",
    "resume": {"headline": "...", "summary": "...",
               "skills": [{"label": "...", "text": "..."}, ...],
               "experience": {"<heading from the outline>": ["bullet", ...], ...}},
    "cover_letter": {"to": "Hiring Team", "greeting": "Dear Hiring Team,", "paragraphs": ["...", ...]}}
   "skills" is the full list in order. Each "experience" list replaces that block's bullets ([] drops a group);
   role, company and date lines never change. If it prints "problems" (resume over 2 pages, cover letter over 1),
   shorten docs.json and run it again. Don't write a python script to build the documents.
   Write the cover letter the way materials/context/voice.md asks when it's there (tone, length, opening, words to
   avoid, the person's own notes; sample letters set the voice only, never the facts).
   Also write notes.md (fit/gap table, pay ask, form answers, short screen prep). Keep it to what's true in materials/.
   If data/applications/<slug>/ already has the PDFs and a plan.json from an earlier prep-only run, reuse them: skip
   step 2 and go on to step 3.
3. If the posting is on Workday or another site that needs an account, don't scan it. Write plan.json (the shape in
   step 5, "url" = the posting) answering the usual questions: why this company, why this role, pay ask (from
   CLAUDE.local.md), start date, notice period, years with the role's key skill. Run
   `autoapply fill data/applications/<slug>/plan.json --job {{JOB_ID}} --prep-only`, say "apply by hand" in
   notes.md, and stop.
4. `autoapply scan <apply url>` for the form's questions.
5. Write data/applications/<slug>/plan.json:
   {"url": "<apply url>", "ats": "<greenhouse|lever|ashby|...>",
    "files": {"resume": "<abs path to resume pdf>", "cover_letter": "<abs path to cover pdf>"},
    "answers": {"<question label exactly as scanned>": "<answer>", ...}}
   Answer every question the profile doesn't already cover, short and specific. Leave out consents and
   self-ID questions: the filler handles those from the person's own standing answers.
   Use the PDF paths `autoapply build-docs` printed.
6. `autoapply fill data/applications/<slug>/plan.json --job {{JOB_ID}}`. Its output ends with "checks_failed": the
   pre-submit checks (stale or over-long PDFs, missing job dates, placeholders, unanswered required questions).
   Fix what you can (edit docs.json and rerun build-docs, answer a question) and fill again (max 2 more tries).
   Consent and self-ID checks are the person's to settle: leave those.
   If fill stops with "Not filled: already applied for this role", the person applied to it already (by hand or
   another way). That is not an error: don't retry or work around it; print "<Company>: already applied, skipped".
7. Print one line, naming any check still failing: "<Company> (<title>): ready to review" or "<Company>: apply by hand"
   or "<Company>: prepped, apply by hand" or what went wrong.
