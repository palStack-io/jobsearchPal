Today's job search, step 1 of the daily run: pick the roles worth applying to. Follow AGENTS.md.
Be brief and economical: this step should take a few minutes, not an hour. Don't open files you don't need.

Already done before you started: email sync and `autoapply find` (new roles from watched boards and job sites).

1. `autoapply list --limits` gives `picks_per_day` (N). If N is 0, write `[]` to data/daily/picks.json and stop.
2. `autoapply candidates` lists the best new roles, pre-ranked by a cheap score, with trimmed descriptions.
   Work from this list. Use `autoapply show <id>` only for a close call.
3. `autoapply alerts` gives yesterday's job-alert emails (LinkedIn, Indeed, HigherEdJobs...). Pull out only roles
   that clearly fit. For each, find the same posting on the company's own careers page (ATS URL); if it's gone
   there, skip it. Track live ones with `autoapply add <ats url> --company <name> --title <title>`.
   If WebFetch shows the careers page with no jobs listed (many load the list with a script, often an embedded
   Paycom, iCIMS or UKG board), run `autoapply careers <careers page url> --title "<title>"` before calling it
   gone: it opens the page in a real browser and lists the job links, best title match first.
   Feed roles (ats "feed") you want to pick need the same hop to the real posting first.

4. Pick the best N by fit (against materials/ and CLAUDE.local.md), then freshness, then pay; at most one role per company.
   Levels: when config.yaml lists `search.levels`, every level there is equally wanted. A mid-level title ("Data
   Engineer", no Senior) is not a weaker fit than a senior one, and a lower posted range alone is no reason to skip it.
   Fit decides, never the weekly work-search number: don't pick a weak fit to make up a count. Fewer, better applications
   go further, and the person can log other activities (contacts, workshops) for the week. Skip anything
   already applied to (`autoapply list --status submitted`, materials/applications/). `autoapply skip <id> [<id> ...]
   --reason "..."` clears misses from the candidate list in one call (one reason per call).
5. Write data/daily/picks.json: [{"id": "<job id>", "why": "<one line on fit>"}], best first.
   Workday and other account-based sites can't be filled: still pick them if they're the best fit, and add
   "by_hand": true.
6. Print one line: the picks, e.g. "Picked: Acme (Sr Analytics Eng), Globex (Data Eng Mgr)", or "No good matches today".
